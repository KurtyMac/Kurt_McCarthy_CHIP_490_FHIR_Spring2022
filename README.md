Welcome to Kurt McCarthy's Repository for CHIP490.

<b>Introduction:<b> 

Hello, I’m Kurt McCarthy and I’m currently a program analyst for the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) for the Department of Defense (DoD). I was an Army Officer in the 3rd Infantry Division prior to taking this role. I have an MBA from UNC Kenan-Flagler and am now pursuing a Master of Science in Biomedical and Health Informatics from UNC. My interests consist of data analytics, statistics, programming, and other data-oriented applications. 

<b>Data Topics of Interest:</b> 

<b>Population Health Based Statistics:</b> Addressing health equity and disparities for populations that receive sub-standard medical care. There are specific populations that lack proper access to health care within our nation, I would like to run statistical algorithms such as k-means clsuter analysis and regression to infer why these population recieve worse care than others. 

<b>Machine Learning Utilization for Health Diagnosis & Treatment:</b> Utilize machine learning to evaluate medical reports, lab results, imagining, and biomarkers to help predict the chances of disease or diagnose the type of disease.

<b>Project Ideas:<b>
  
<b>Increase Military Medical Readiness Through Data Analysis Dashboard:</b> Data mine military readiness records to infer why injuries are occurring to come up with plans to decrease injury rates and unnecessary disease progression. Create a dashboard that commanders can utilize to see the exact reason why their unit readiness is low. For example, “increased muscle skeletal injuries, finding out that the running surface at the unit level is concreate”.
